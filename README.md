# San Diego Burrito Analysis
Used the data set on San Diego Burritos from Kaggle (www.kaggle.com/srcole/burritos-in-san-diego) to investigate how ingredients 
effect the cost of a burrito using location as a random effect.

We made two models to analyze:
* Looked at only meat ingredients to determine how each affected the cost.
* Looked at all 10 common burrito ingredients to determine how each affected the cost
